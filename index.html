			<p>The Proposal</p>
			<p>Rashna was going to visit me 2 weeks before our engagement function with family and friends (about a hundred of them) in Toronto, and I hadn't proposed yet! I was planning on taking her to Big Sur and popping the question there. I, however, fell sick a few days prior and she cancelled her trip as I had not the energy to make the trip worthwhile. 
			</p>
			<p>I was in a pinch and a time crunch. Two weeks left and no more opportunities to see her before the big function. But poor Rashna would  be heart-broken if she never got proposed to. So I decided to fly to Toronto the following weekend, one week early. This was an elaborate scheme, a surprise proposal, involving my family, her parents and….a proposal planner! After a few futile attempts to plan something in a city I hadn't lived in for years, Rashna's mom discovered that there is such a thing as a proposal planner. I jumped at the opportunity to get professional advice on planning/locations in Toronto.
