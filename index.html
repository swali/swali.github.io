				<h3>The Proposal <br>(as told by Sandeep)</h3>
				<img src="images/proposal/proposal.jpg">
				<p>Rashna was going to visit me 2 weeks before our engagement function with family and friends (about a hundred of them) in Toronto, and I hadn't proposed yet! I was planning on taking her to Big Sur and popping the question there. I, however, fell sick a few days prior and she cancelled her trip as I had not the energy to make the trip worthwhile. 
				</p>
				<p>I was in a pinch and a time crunch. Two weeks left and no more opportunities to see her before the big function. But I couldn't miss my only opportunity ever to propose, so I decided to fly to Toronto the following weekend, one week early. This was an elaborate scheme, a surprise proposal, involving my family, her parents andâ€¦.a proposal planner! After a few futile attempts to plan something in a city I hadn't lived in for years, Rashna's mom discovered that there is such a thing as a proposal planner. I jumped at the opportunity to get professional advice on planning/locations in Toronto.
				</p>
				<p>The setup: I found a really pretty Japanese park in Mississauga, close to where our families live, and got her mom to bring her there on the pretense of meeting a photographer. Her mom brought her there and then made a silent, swift exit. Rashna, tasked with finding the photographer, walked through the park, where I mysteriously appeared. She was shocked to see me, as I was messaging her in chat claiming to be in Sunnyvale just a few minutes prior, but also happy at the same time. As I walked her to the spot I had picked out by the little lake, under a tree, I tried to explain what was happening to her. Rashna was still in a daze when I dropped to one knee and asked her to marry me. After she said yes, we feasted on some cake on a little table nearby I had prepared.
